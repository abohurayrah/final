However, the 10% retention (totaling SAR 3,348,270) [Source: Calculation based on ac.pdf, Page 4, 5] withheld until project milestones (PAC/FAC) creates significant working capital pressure. Monthly payments occur after work completion and invoice approval (within 20 working days) [Source: ac.pdf, Page 13], requiring the contractor to finance operations during this lag.",

The 10% retention significantly impacts cumulative cash flow throughout the project. Delays in invoice approvals or payments by the client/consultant would further strain cash flow. Upfront costs for mobilization, guarantees, and insurance also require funding.",

Repayment capacity exists from the initial advance payment [Source: ac.pdf, Page 12] and subsequent monthly progress payments, assuming timely project execution and payment receipts. The average monthly billing potential (approx. SAR 1.4M before retention) [Source: Calculation based on ac.pdf, Page 4, 14] supports servicing the loan within the term.",

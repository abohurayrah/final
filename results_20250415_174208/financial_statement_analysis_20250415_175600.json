Asset turnover (1.41 in 2024 [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Pages 2-3; ab.pdf, Page 4]) shows reasonable efficiency in generating revenue from assets, though slightly down from 2023 (1.77 [Source: Calculation based on ab.pdf, Pages 4-5]).

The loan request of SAR 1.5m for working capital seems small relative to the existing working capital level and the large increase observed. However, the composition is poor: cash is very low (SAR 0.53m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]), while receivables constitute the vast majority (SAR 122.4m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]), especially related party receivables (SAR 65.8m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]). This suggests the working capital need stems from inability to collect receivables rather than operational growth funding. The company appears to be financing its related parties. The loan might provide temporary liquidity but doesn't address the underlying issue of poor cash conversion cycle due to receivables."

Average monthly net profit in 2024 was approximately SAR 4.4m [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Page 3], covering the estimated principal payment many times over (Profit Coverage Ratio ~17.5x [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Page 3 and Loan Request]). HOWEVER, the historical negative operating cash flow (2023 OCF: SAR -0.4m [Source: ab.pdf, Page 7], 2022 OCF: SAR -0.7m [Source: ab.pdf, Page 7]) and the critically low cash balance (SAR 0.53m at Dec 31, 2024 [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]) are major red flags. The company has not demonstrated an ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to cover its needs, let alone service new debt. Repayment relies heavily on collecting the massive receivables (especially related party) or potentially refinancing the new short-term debt (SAR 40.8m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]). The lack of 2024 cash flow data makes it impossible to assess if this situation has improved. Repayment capacity from a cash flow perspective is highly questionable based on available data."

While profitability and growth are impressive, the severe disconnect between profits and cash flow, driven by ballooning (related party) receivables, poses a significant risk.

The missing 2024 cash flow statement is a critical information gap."

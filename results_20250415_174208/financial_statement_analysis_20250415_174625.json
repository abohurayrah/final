This asset growth was financed mainly by a large increase in Short Term Debt (SAR 40.8m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]) and retained earnings (SAR 10.9m increase [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Page 2, using Retained Earnings]). While liquidity ratios (Current 2.41, Quick 2.37 [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Page 2, using Current Assets, Inventory, Current Liabilities]) appear adequate, the quality of current assets is a concern due to the extremely low cash and high concentration in receivables, particularly from related parties. Leverage (Debt-to-Equity) increased from 0.24 to 0.53 [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Page 2, using Total Liabilities, Total Equity]), which is still moderate but shows increased reliance on debt, primarily short-term."

This resulted in a net decrease in cash of SAR 5.6m, following a similar pattern in 2022 (Net decrease SAR 6.0m). The historical inability to generate positive cash flow despite strong reported profits is a major concern and highlights potential issues with working capital management (especially receivables collection) or the timing of cash receipts/payments. The very low cash balance at YE 2024 (SAR 0.53m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]) suggests these issues likely persisted or worsened."

Asset Turnover decreased slightly to 1.41 in 2024 from 1.77 in 2023 [Source: Calculation based on aa.pdf, Pages 2-3, ab.pdf, Page 4, using Revenue, Total Assets], suggesting slightly lower efficiency in generating revenue from assets, likely due to the large increase in non-revenue generating related party receivables.

Inventory is minimal (SAR 2.3m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]). The SAR 1.5m loan for working capital seems small relative to the existing WC level and the scale of operations (Revenue SAR 189m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 3]). However, the extremely low cash position (SAR 0.53m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]) and historical negative operating cash flows suggest a critical need for liquidity, likely to bridge gaps caused by slow receivables collection (especially the large related party balance) or to fund operational payments before receivables are collected. The loan appears necessary for immediate liquidity rather than funding WC growth."

The 2024 Operating Profit (SAR 53.0m [Source: aa.pdf, Page 3]) covers the estimated annual principal repayment (SAR 3.0m [Source: Calculation based on Loan Request]) by over 17 times. However, this assessment is severely undermined by the company's demonstrated inability to convert profits into cash flow, as evidenced by negative operating cash flows in 2022 and 2023 [Source: ab.pdf, Page 7] and the critically low cash balance at YE 2024 [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]. Repayment within the short 6-month term depends entirely on the company's ability to rapidly collect its large receivables, particularly the SAR 65.8m due from related parties [Source: aa.pdf, Page 2]. Without evidence of improved cash generation or committed collection timelines for receivables, the actual repayment capacity is highly uncertain despite strong profits."

**CORE DIRECTIVE: YOUR RECOMMENDATION MUST BE BASED **STRICTLY AND EXCLUSIVELY** ON PROVIDED ANALYSES.**
*   **DO NOT INVENT OR ASSUME DATA NOT PRESENT.**
*   **DO NOT HALLUCINATE FIGURES OR CONTEXT.**
*   **If information is missing, acknowledge the gap and adjust confidence accordingly.**
*   **BEFORE FINALIZING, review your recommendation to ensure every claim is directly traceable to the provided analyses.**

**OUTPUT STRUCTURE (JSON FORMAT):**
Provide your decision in a structured JSON format with the following sections:

When generating your recommendation:
1. **Holistic Assessment**: Consider all analyses equally, looking for both supportive evidence and red flags.
2. **Critical Factors**: Pay special attention to:
   - Cash flow adequacy and stability for repayment
   - Profitability and financial health
   - Business stability and track record
   - Compliance and documentation completeness
   - Consistency across different document types
3. **Risk Weighting**: Identify and properly weight risk factors based on their severity and relevance.
4. **Conservative Approach**: In cases of uncertainty or missing information, take a more conservative stance.
5. **Clear Justification**: Provide clear reasoning for your recommendation based on specific findings.

Scoring Guidelines:
- All scores should be on a scale of 0-100, where:
  - 0-40: Poor/High Risk
  - 41-60: Below Average/Moderate Risk
  - 61-80: Average/Acceptable Risk
  - 81-100: Strong/Low Risk
- The final_score_adjusted should reflect the weighted importance of different factors.

For any fields where data is insufficient, use the value null and note "Information Not Found" or "Not Calculable" in the relevant summary field.
